This program consists of two parts. I have used an Arduino Uno board which communicates with an Windows application.

Firstly, this app provides a music player. What's special about this one is that you can play/pause the music by knocking the table or by clapping your hands twice, play the next song by knocking/clapping three time and the previous by knocking/clapping four times.

Secondly, I have used a temperature sensor. The temperature in your room is displayed on the screen.

When your room is dark a lamp is turned on.

You can play a game on the LCD display.

It reminds you which is your main purpose for that day.

It displays the clock.
