# Moments

This program consists of two parts. I have used an Arduino Uno board which communicates with an windows application.

Firstly, this app provides a music player. What is special about this one is that you can play/pause the musc by kncoking in the table or clapping your hands twice. You press the forward button by clapping your hands three time. Your press the backward button by clapping your hands four times.

Secondly, I have used a temperature sensor. The temperature in your room is displayed on the screen.

When there is dark in your room a lamp is turned on.

You can play a game on the LCD display.

It reminds you which is your main purpose for that day.

It displays the clock.
